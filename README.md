## twinBASIC Device Manager

(I was planning on posting a beta sooner, standing by for resolution of tB bug)

Beta candidate 1 (UNTESTED) - tbDevMan-Beta.twinproj

Alpha candidate 1 (UNTESTED) - tbDevMan-Alpha.twinproj

Pre-alpha 2 posted: Successfully adds all devices.

Pre-alpha posted; it currently just enumerates the device categories into the TreeView (with icon) before crashing out trying to add child nodes of actual devices, but some people wanted to see the progress on that.
